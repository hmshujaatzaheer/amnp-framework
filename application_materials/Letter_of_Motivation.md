Dear Professor Carrasquilla,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD position in **computational quantum many-body physics** and **machine learning** under your direct supervision at ETH Zürich. With my Master of Science in Computer Science specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, I am highly motivated to contribute to your research on **neural quantum states**, **variational algorithms**, and **non-Hermitian systems**—areas where my background in **deep learning optimization**, **tensor computations**, and **sampling methods** provides natural entry points.

Your research trajectory—from foundational work on **recurrent neural network wave functions** to recent breakthroughs in **Majorana string propagation** (D'Anna et al., 2025) and **fermionic neural Gibbs states** (Nys & Carrasquilla, 2025)—demonstrates how **neural network representations** can fundamentally transform our ability to simulate strongly correlated quantum systems across equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. This powerful interplay between **machine learning** and **quantum many-body physics** resonates deeply with my academic preparation in **gradient-based optimization**, **stochastic sampling**, and advanced **neural network architectures** through frameworks including **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**.

Through my Master's coursework and IBM **Deep Learning** certification, I developed expertise in **backpropagation**, **automatic differentiation**, **loss function minimization**, and **variational inference**—mathematical structures that parallel **variational Monte Carlo**, **quantum state parameterization**, and **fidelity optimization**. My KAIST **Quantum Information** certification established strong foundational knowledge in **quantum mechanics**, **entanglement**, and **quantum gates**. Since 2016, I have taught numerous graduate students from CUNY, Long Island University, and University of Texas at Dallas, covering **algorithm design**, **complexity analysis**, and **optimization routines**, which sharpened my ability to translate theoretical concepts into computational practice.

I am particularly interested in addressing the **optimizer incompatibility** identified in your kagome lattice work: "**Stochastic Reconfiguration is not as effective as Adam optimizer when applied to RNN wave functions**" (Hibat-Allah et al., 2025). Your **Majorana propagation** framework achieves remarkable accuracy for **2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics** but truncation rules assume **Fock-state initial conditions**—breaking for generic **variational states**. Furthermore, your groundbreaking **fermionic neural Gibbs states** are restricted to **Hermitian closed systems**, with extensions to **non-Hermitian steady states** requiring "**new theoretical frameworks**" (Nys & Carrasquilla, 2025). I propose developing **geometry-aware optimizers** that reconcile **Stochastic Reconfiguration** with **autoregressive architectures**, extending **Majorana truncation** to **non-Hermitian Hamiltonians** with **complex eigenvalue spectra**, and advancing **neural thermal states** toward **dissipative fermionic dynamics** and **open quantum systems**.

Your publications in *Science*, *Nature Physics*, *Physical Review Research*, and *Communications Physics* demonstrate commitment to rigorous **computational methods** and experimentally relevant **quantum simulation**. I am committed to contributing through innovative **algorithm development**, **large-scale numerical simulations**, and active collaborative engagement with your group's interdisciplinary work spanning **condensed matter theory**, **quantum computing**, and **machine learning** for quantum systems.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my strong background in **optimization theory**, **neural network training**, and **variational algorithms** can meaningfully contribute to groundbreaking research in your laboratory.

Sincerely,

H M Shujaat Zaheer
