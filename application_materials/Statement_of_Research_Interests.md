My path to **quantum many-body physics** began unexpectedly during my Master's coursework in **machine learning optimization**. While studying **gradient descent algorithms** and **loss landscape geometry** in **neural network training**, I encountered a fundamental question: why do certain high-dimensional optimization problems converge efficiently despite the **curse of dimensionality**? This led me to explore **computational complexity theory**, where I first learned that certain problems resist efficient classical solutions—a revelation that **quantum computing** promised to address through fundamentally different computational paradigms.

The turning point came during my **Introduction to Quantum Information** course at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Learning about **quantum superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum gates** felt like discovering a parallel universe of computation. The mathematical elegance of **unitary transformations** and **tensor product spaces** resonated with my background in **linear algebra** and **probability theory** from AI/ML, yet the physical principles—**measurement collapse**, **no-cloning theorem**, **quantum interference**—introduced entirely new computational paradigms that classical algorithms could never exploit.

What captivated me most was discovering Professor Carrasquilla's pioneering work on **neural quantum states**. His foundational paper on **machine learning phases of matter** (Carrasquilla & Melko, 2017) demonstrated how **neural networks** could classify quantum phases, while his **recurrent neural network wave functions** (Hibat-Allah et al., 2020) showed that **autoregressive models** could represent complex **many-body ground states**. Reading his recent 2025 publications crystallized my research direction: the intersection of **neural network representations**, **variational Monte Carlo**, and **non-Hermitian quantum systems** presents extraordinary opportunities for innovation.

Three specific research gaps in Professor Carrasquilla's recent work motivate my proposed contributions. First, the **RNN wave function** study on **kagome lattice Rydberg arrays** (Hibat-Allah et al., 2025) identifies that "**Stochastic Reconfiguration is not as effective as Adam optimizer when applied to RNN wave functions**"—a fundamental **optimizer incompatibility** requiring reconciliation through **geometry-aware preconditioning**. Second, the **Majorana string propagation** framework (D'Anna et al., 2025) achieves remarkable accuracy for **2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics** using **Trotter-consistent truncation**, but the truncation rules assume **Fock-state initial conditions**, breaking for generic **variational states** and lacking extension to **non-Hermitian Hamiltonians**. Third, the **fermionic neural Gibbs states** framework (Nys & Carrasquilla, 2025) accurately captures **thermal properties** of doped **Fermi-Hubbard models** but remains restricted to **Hermitian closed systems**, with future extensions to "**real-time dynamics and non-Hermitian steady states**" explicitly requiring "**new theoretical frameworks**."

I propose addressing these gaps through three interconnected innovations: developing **Geometry-Aware Stochastic Reconfiguration** that adaptively interpolates between curvature-aware and first-order methods based on gradient **signal-to-noise ratio**; extending **Majorana truncation** to **non-Hermitian systems** via **decay-bounded pruning** tied to **complex eigenvalue spectra**; and advancing **neural thermal states** through **thermofield-extended architectures** capable of representing **dissipative dynamics**.

Since 2016, I have taught hundreds of graduate students across **machine learning**, **algorithms**, and **optimization theory**. This experience taught me that genuine understanding requires not just absorbing knowledge but explaining complex concepts clearly and identifying knowledge gaps. Teaching sharpened my ability to decompose difficult problems and persist through technical difficulties—skills essential for PhD research. Yet teaching also revealed limits of my current expertise. When students asked about **quantum machine learning**, I could only provide surface-level answers. This intellectual frustration convinced me that rigorous training in **quantum many-body theory** under Professor Carrasquilla's supervision is essential for meaningful contribution to this transformative field.
