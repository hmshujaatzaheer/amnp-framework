**Subject:** 🔬 PhD Application: Novel AMNP Framework Addressing Gaps in Your 2025 Publications | ML + Quantum Many-Body Physics

---

Dear Prof. Carrasquilla,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the PhD position in computational quantum many-body physics, machine learning, and non-Hermitian systems at your Quantum AI Lab at ETH Zürich.

After an in-depth study of your group's recent publications—particularly:
- **"Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice"** (Commun. Phys. 8:308, 2025)
- **"Majorana string simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics in two-dimensional lattice fermion systems"** (2025)
- **"Fermionic neural Gibbs states"** (2025)

—I have identified specific research gaps and developed a concrete framework to address them.

**I have created a complete open-source implementation:**  
🔗 **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/hmshujaatzaheer/amnp-framework

**The repository contains:**

1. **GASR (Geometry-Aware Stochastic Reconfiguration)**  
   Addresses the observation that *"Stochastic Reconfiguration is not as effective as Adam optimizer when applied to RNN wave functions"* through adaptive interpolation based on gradient signal-to-noise ratio.

2. **NHTCT (Non-Hermitian Trotter-Consistent Truncation)**  
   Extends Majorana string propagation to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenvalue spectra via decay-bounded truncation—directly responding to the future work direction in your Majorana propagation paper.

3. **TENGS (Thermofield-Extended Neural Gibbs States)**  
   Addresses the stated need for *"new theoretical frameworks"* for *"non-Hermitian steady states"* via a non-Hermitian work operator.

**Repository includes:**
- Full JAX/Flax implementation (~2,500 lines of code)
- Mathematical documentation with derivations (`docs/theory.md`)
- Example scripts demonstrating each algorithm
- Unit tests
- My complete application materials (Letter of Motivation, Research Statement, 4-page Research Proposal)

**My Background:**
- MSc Computer Science (AI/ML specialization), University of Sialkot
- Quantum Information certification from KAIST
- Deep Learning certifications from IBM
- 8+ years teaching ML/algorithms to graduate students internationally
- Extensive experience with PyTorch, JAX, and neural network optimization

I am genuinely excited about the possibility of contributing to the intersection of machine learning and quantum many-body physics under your supervision. The research directions outlined in my proposal—particularly the application to dissipative Fermi-Hubbard models and non-Hermitian kagome lattices—align directly with your lab's mission.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in optimization theory and neural architectures could contribute to advancing these research directions.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
